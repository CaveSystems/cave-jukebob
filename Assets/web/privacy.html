                                <h2>1. An overview of data protection</h2>
                                <h3>General</h3>
                                <p>JukeBob manages the music requests of many people on a player and stores a name, a password and a generated image for each user.</p>
                                <p>JukeBob uses a session cookie to identify users when they visit JukeBob. Detailed information on the subject of data protection can be found in our privacy policy found below.</p>

                                <h3>Data collection within JukeBob</h3>
                                <p><strong>Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?</strong></p>
                                <p>The data collected on this website are processed by the JukeBob operator. The operator's device information can be found too in the JukeBob's <a href="/legal">legal notice</a>.</p>
                                <p>Device: {{HostInformations.Name}}</p>
                                <p><i>There is no data processing by the developer of JukeBob!</i></p>

                                <p><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></p>
                                <p>Some data are collected when you provide it to us. This is the username and password you choose to access and use when logging in to JukeBob.</p>
                                <p>
                                    Other data are collected automatically by the JukeBob Server system when you visit the JukeBob user interface.
                                    These data are primarily technical data such as the browser and operating system you are using or when you accessed the page.
                                    These data are collected automatically as soon as you enter JukeBob.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>What do we use your data for?</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    The data is collected to ensure error-free delivery of the JukeBob interface. This data could also be used to analyze your user behavior (who wants which song).
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                    You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge.
                                    You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time using the address given in the legal notice
                                    if you have further questions about the issue of privacy and data protection. You may also, of course, file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.
                                </p>

                                <h2>2. General information and mandatory information</h2>

                                <h3>Data protection</h3>
                                <p>
                                    JukeBob takes the protection of your personal data very seriously.
                                    We treat your personal data as confidential and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If you use JukeBob, various pieces of personal data will be collected. Personal information is any data with which you could be personally identified.
                                    This privacy policy explains what information we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.
                                </p>
                                <p>Please note that the data transfer via HTTP can not be protected against access by third parties.</p>

                                <h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of your data</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent.
                                    You may revoke your consent at any time with future effect. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before
                                    we receive your request may still be legally processed.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Right to file complaints with regulatory authorities</h3>
                                <p>
                                    If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities.
                                    The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection legislation is the data protection officer of the state in which the JukeBob operator is headquartered.
                                    A list of data protection officers and their contact details can be found at the following link:

                                <p>

                                <h2>3. Data collection on our website</h2>
                                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                                <p>
                                    JukeBob uses a so-called session cookie.
                                    Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses.
                                    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser.
                                    The session cookie is valid for one day and becomes invalid when the app is restarted.
                                    These cookies allow us to recognize you and associate your actions in the interface with your username.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.
                                    Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete
                                    cookies when closing your browser. When deactivating cookies, it is no longer possible to send a music request.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The session cookie is systemically important for handling song requests, a use of cookies for purposes other than those described here is excluded.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Registration at JukeBob </h3>
                                <p>
                                    You need to register with JukeBob to make specific song requests or to customize JukeBob settings (as administrator).
                                    We use the data entered for the assignment of the rights (user or administrator) and for the display of who requested which song.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The processing of the data entered during registration takes place on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. GDPR).
                                    You can revoke your consent at any time. An informal message to the operator of JukeBob is sufficient.
                                    The legality of the already completed data processing remains unaffected by the revocation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The data collected during registration will be stored by us as long as you are registered on this JukeBob instance and will subsequently be deleted.
                                    Legal retention periods remain unaffected.
                                </p>
